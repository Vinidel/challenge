# PragmaTeam Challenge

This project constains the solution for the PragmaTeam Restaurant Challenge.

#Instructions
Please clone it with https://github.com/Vinidel/challenge.git

Don't forget to npm install

If you want to play with it please start the server with the command line "./bin/www"

If you want to test it please use the command line "npm test"

#Frameworks and tools

- Angular
- NodeJs
- Express (server)
- npm (for dependencies)
- Middleware static for html,css,etc

#Tests

I didn't have too much time so all tests are located in the same test.js file.

- Supertest (testing)
- Mocha (Make the test results more colorful)

#Considerations

I think the hoghlight of the project was how to check if the restaurant has been chosen twice in the same week. With this function I coul learn more about date manipulation.

I discover the sweet alert, it is a very nice API to show messages.

What I think I could have done better:
- Should use MVC
- Should use middleware to handle the User;
- Should router to organise the routes;
